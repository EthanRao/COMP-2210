# COMP-2210

COMP 2210 (Java)

## Course Description

COMP 2210 is designed to introduce fundamental data structures and associated algorithms, as well as applications in which they are commonly used. An object-oriented approach to problem solving and program design will be emphasized in the lecture and reinforced in the lab.

**Bulletin Description:** Software development in the context of collections (e.g., lists, trees, graphs, hashtables). Communication, teamwork, and a design experience are integral course experiences.

## Development Environment:
You will need a development environment to write programs using the JDK. This could be something as simple as a good text editor and the command line, or as complex as a large, professional-grade IDE such as Eclipse. The recommended development environment for the course is jGRASP. It has a rich set of features but is lightweight and easy to use. The jGRASP viewers provide a visual debugging capability that will be especially useful in this course as you develop programs that use data structures. jGRASP is freely available at:

Both Eclipse and jGRASP are also installed in the Engineering labs. The course staff will answer any question you have regarding installation and configuration of jGRASP, but not necessarily any other IDE. If you would like to try the command-line-only option, Sublime Text, Atom, and Vim are excellent multi-platform editors with language-aware features, and I can recommend all three.
